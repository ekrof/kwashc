/**
 * The blog allows the user to provide a link to their homepage in their comments. It tries to html escape this output
 * through <c:out...>, but this is the wrong context, since it is used as an html attribute. It can can be used as a XSS
 * vector using "javascript:alert('Evil script')". The attribute is also not properly contained in brackets in the jsp,
 * so an input of "abc onmouseover=alert('evil script')" will also work.
 *
 * Solution: The easiest solution is to validate the user supplied URLs by parsing them as the strictly typed
 * java.net.URL.
 *
 * You should also 1) contain the attribute in quotes, and 2) properly escape the HTML attribute. The latter is
 * difficult without introducing a framework such as OWASP ESAPI, which has tools for escaping data for a number of
 * different contexts. JSTL's fn.escapeAsXml() *might* provide some coverage, and *might* not break valid URLs. The test
 * doesn't cover these two subjects.
